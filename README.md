# Binary_NLP

This repository contains code for a simple Natural Language Processing (NLP) task using binary classification.  It appears to be designed for a task where the goal is to classify text into one of two categories.

## Overview

The project consists of the following files:

*   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
*   `main.py`:  This is the main script that contains the NLP logic.
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python packages required to run the project.

## Functionality

While a detailed description of the functionality is not available without analyzing the `main.py` file, we can infer the general purpose from the project structure.

The `main.py` script likely performs the following steps:

1.  **Data Loading:** Loads the text data to be classified.  This data could be read from a file or obtained from an external source.
2.  **Preprocessing:**  Cleans and prepares the text data for analysis.  This might include:
    *   Lowercasing the text.
    *   Removing punctuation.
    *   Tokenization (splitting the text into words or subwords).
    *   Removing stop words (common words like "the", "a", "is" that don't carry much meaning).
    *   Stemming or lemmatization (reducing words to their root form).
3.  **Feature Extraction:** Converts the preprocessed text into numerical features that can be used by a machine learning model. Common techniques include:
    *   Bag-of-Words (BoW)
    *   TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
    *   Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, or more modern transformers).
4.  **Model Training:** Trains a binary classification model on the extracted features.  Possible models include:
    *   Logistic Regression
    *   Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    *   Naive Bayes
    *   (Potentially) a simple Neural Network
5.  **Evaluation:**  Evaluates the performance of the trained model on a test dataset.  Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are commonly used.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need to install the required Python packages. You can do this using `pip`:

pip install -r requirements.txt


This command will install all the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.  The file likely includes packages like:

*   `nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit) or `spaCy` (for NLP tasks)
*   `scikit-learn` (for machine learning)
*   `numpy` (for numerical computation)

## Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Giezi023/Binary_NLP.git
    cd Binary_NLP
    ```

2.  **Install the requirements:**

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the `main.py` script:**

    ```
    python main.py
    ```

    You may need to modify the `main.py` script to specify the input data file or other parameters.
